## Credits
The feature extraction, lidar-only odometry and baseline implemented were heavily derived or taken from the orignal [LOAM](http://wiki.ros.org/loam_velodyne) and its [modified version](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne), and one of the initialization methods and the optimization pipeline from [VINS-mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono).
